# 🌈 More options than's reasonable…

This component allows you to configure most anything for the humble HMTL <select>. To have to fiddle and jiddle with all of these controls for every select in your design would be a waste of time that could be spent on life’s better pursuits (like anything else, at all).

Instead, use this component as the base to create the custom select components your design, or system, call for (e.g. a "Standard Select", "Featured Select", "Alison's Select”).

Then when Alison finally makes good on her threats of leaving it all for the Peace Corp and you need to switch everything over to “Jacob's Select”, just go back to the design component you created and do a bit quick fiddling and jiddling with all the crazy controls afforded here to make Jacob happy (of course, let everyone know it was a huge effort and use the extra time for those better pursuits we chatted about earlier).
 
 
## 🌧 Sometimes…
Sometimes when you update the component’s options you won’t see the changes shown on the canvas; this seems to be a bug in Framer. To fix, simply toggle the visibility of the component off and back on.
